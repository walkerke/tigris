Description from the US Census Bureau: "The Census Bureau includes landmarks
such as military installations in the MAF/TIGER database for
locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau adds
landmark features to the database on an as-needed basis and does not attempt to ensure that all
instances of a particular feature are included. For additional information about area landmarks, please
see Section 3.12, Landmarks (Area and Point)."
}
\details{
This file does not include the three point landmarks identified as military installation features in the
MAF/TIGER database. These point landmarks are included in the point landmark shapefile.
Although almost all military installations have assigned 8-character National Standard (GNIS) codes, the
Census Bureau has not loaded most of this data into the MAF/TIGER database. The 2020 military
shapefiles contain few values in the ANSICODE field.

\section{Additional Arguments}{

Additional arguments that can be passed in \code{...} are:
\itemize{
\item \code{class} Desired class of return object: \code{"sf"} (the default) or \code{"sp"}. sp
classes should be considered deprecated as of tigris version 2.0, but legacy
support is still available.
\item \code{progress_bar} If set to \code{FALSE}, do not display download progress bar
(helpful for R Markdown documents). Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
\item \code{keep_zipped_shapefile} If set to \code{TRUE}, do not delete zipped shapefile
(stored in temporary directory or \code{TIGRIS_CACHE_DIR} depending on the
configuration of global option \code{"tigris_use_cache"}). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{refresh} Whether to re-download cached shapefiles (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}). The
default is either \code{FALSE} or the value of global option \code{"tigris_refresh"}
if it is set. Specifying this argument will override the behavior set in
\code{"tigris_refresh"} global option.
\item \code{filter_by} Geometry used to filter the output returned by the function.
Can be an sf OR sfc object, an object of class \code{bbox}, or a length-4 vector
of format \code{c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)} that can be converted to a bbox.
Geometries that intersect the input to \code{filter_by} will be returned.
\item \code{crs} Output coordinate reference system. All TIGER/Shapefiles use a EPSG
4269 coordinate reference system.
\item \code{query} A SQL query passed to \code{\link[sf:st_read]{sf::st_read()}}.
