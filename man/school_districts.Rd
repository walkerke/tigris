\title{Download a school district shapefile into R}
\usage{
school_districts(state = NULL, type = "unified", cb = FALSE, year = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{The two-digit FIPS code (string) of the state you want. Can also
be state name or state abbreviation. When \code{NULL} and combined with
\code{cb = TRUE}, a national dataset of school districts will be returned for
years 2019 and later.}

\item{type}{Specify whether you want to return a unified school district (the default, \code{'unified'}),
an elementary school district (\code{'elementary'}), or a secondary school district (\code{'secondary'}).
Please note: elementary and secondary school districts do not exist in all states}

\item{cb}{if TRUE, download a generalized (1:500k)
school districts file.  Defaults to FALSE (the most detailed TIGER/Line file)}

\item{year}{the data year; defaults to 2022}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to internal function \code{load_tiger}, which is
not exported. See Additional Arguments.}

\description{
From the US Census Bureau (see link for source):
School Districts are single-purpose administrative units within which local officials provide public
educational services for the area's residents. The Census Bureau obtains school district boundaries,
names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels biennially from state
education officials. The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the
U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children in poverty within each
school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to
determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districts.
}
\details{
The Census Bureau creates pseudo-unified school districts for areas in which unified school districts do
not exist.  Additionally, elementary and secondary school districts do not exist in all states.
Please see the link for more information on how the Census Bureau creates the school district shapefiles.

\section{Additional Arguments}{

Additional arguments that can be passed in \code{...} are:
\itemize{
\item \code{class} Desired class of return object: \code{"sf"} (the default) or \code{"sp"}. sp
classes should be considered deprecated as of tigris version 2.0, but legacy
support is still available.
\item \code{progress_bar} If set to \code{FALSE}, do not display download progress bar
(helpful for R Markdown documents). Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
\item \code{keep_zipped_shapefile} If set to \code{TRUE}, do not delete zipped shapefile
(stored in temporary directory or \code{TIGRIS_CACHE_DIR} depending on the
configuration of global option \code{"tigris_use_cache"}). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{refresh} Whether to re-download cached shapefiles (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}). The
default is either \code{FALSE} or the value of global option \code{"tigris_refresh"}
if it is set. Specifying this argument will override the behavior set in
\code{"tigris_refresh"} global option.
\item \code{filter_by} Geometry used to filter the output returned by the function.
Can be an sf OR sfc object, an object of class \code{bbox}, or a length-4 vector
of format \code{c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)} that can be converted to a bbox.
Geometries that intersect the input to \code{filter_by} will be returned.
\item \code{crs} Output coordinate reference system. All TIGER/Shapefiles use a EPSG
4269 coordinate reference system.
\item \code{query} A SQL query passed to \code{\link[sf:st_read]{sf::st_read()}}.
}
