\title{Download a Census tracts shapefile into R, and optionally subset by county}
\usage{
tracts(
  state = NULL,
  county = NULL,
  cb = FALSE,
  resolution = "500k",
  year = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{The two-digit FIPS code (string) of the state you want. Can also
be state name or state abbreviation. When \code{NULL} and combined with \code{cb = TRUE}, a national dataset of Census tracts will be returned for years 2019
and later.}

\item{county}{The three-digit FIPS code (string) of the county you'd like to
subset for, or a vector of FIPS codes if you desire multiple counties. Can
also be a county name or vector of names.}

\item{cb}{If cb is set to TRUE, download a generalized (1:500k) tracts file.
Defaults to FALSE (the most detailed TIGER/Line file)}

\item{resolution}{The resolution of the cartographic boundary file (if using
cb = TRUE). Defaults to "500k"; the other option is "5m" (1:5 million).
Resolution of "5m" is only available for the national Census tract file for
years 2022 and later.}

\item{year}{the data year; defaults to 2022}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to internal function \code{load_tiger}, which is
not exported. See Additional Arguments.}

\description{
Description from the US Census Bureau (see link for source):
Census Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a
county or equivalent entity that are updated by local participants prior to
each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical
Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineates census tracts in situations where
no local participant existed or where state, local, or tribal governments
declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a
stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data.
}
\details{
Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000
people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually covers a
contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts varies widely
depending on the density of settlement.  Census tract boundaries are
delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that
statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. Census tracts
occasionally are split due to population growth or merged as a result of
substantial population decline.

Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.
They may follow nonvisible legal boundaries, such as minor civil division
(MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations, to
allow for census-tract-to-governmental-unit relationships where the
governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and
county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census
geographic hierarchy.

\section{Additional Arguments}{

Additional arguments that can be passed in \code{...} are:
\itemize{
\item \code{class} Desired class of return object: \code{"sf"} (the default) or \code{"sp"}. sp
classes should be considered deprecated as of tigris version 2.0, but legacy
support is still available.
\item \code{progress_bar} If set to \code{FALSE}, do not display download progress bar
(helpful for R Markdown documents). Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
\item \code{keep_zipped_shapefile} If set to \code{TRUE}, do not delete zipped shapefile
(stored in temporary directory or \code{TIGRIS_CACHE_DIR} depending on the
configuration of global option \code{"tigris_use_cache"}). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{refresh} Whether to re-download cached shapefiles (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}). The
default is either \code{FALSE} or the value of global option \code{"tigris_refresh"}
if it is set. Specifying this argument will override the behavior set in
\code{"tigris_refresh"} global option.
\item \code{filter_by} Geometry used to filter the output returned by the function.
Can be an sf OR sfc object, an object of class \code{bbox}, or a length-4 vector
of format \code{c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)} that can be converted to a bbox.
Geometries that intersect the input to \code{filter_by} will be returned.
\item \code{crs} Output coordinate reference system. All TIGER/Shapefiles use a EPSG
4269 coordinate reference system.
\item \code{query} A SQL query passed to \code{\link[sf:st_read]{sf::st_read()}}.
