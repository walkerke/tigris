\title{Helper function to retrieve Census data via TigerWeb API}
\usage{
load_tiger_api(
  url,
  where = NULL,
  tigris_type = NULL,
  class = getOption("tigris_class", "sf"),
  filter_by = NULL,
  fields = NULL,
  predicate = "intersects",
  page_size = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{URL for the TigerWeb REST API service endpoint}

\item{where}{String containing a WHERE clause for the query (e.g., "STATE = '17' AND COUNTY = '031'")}

\item{tigris_type}{Added as an attribute to return object (used internally)}

\item{class}{Class of return object. Must be one of "sf" (the default) or "sp"}

\item{filter_by}{Geometry used to filter the output returned by the function. Can be an sf object, an object of class \code{bbox}, or a length-4 vector of format \code{c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)} that can be converted to a bbox. Geometries that intersect the input to \code{filter_by} will be returned.}

\item{fields}{Character vector of field names to return. Default is to return all fields.}

\item{predicate}{Spatial predicate to use with filter_by. Default "intersects". Possible options are "intersects", "contains", "crosses", "overlaps", "touches", and "within".}

\item{page_size}{The maximum number of features to return per request. Useful when requests return a 500 error code.}
}
\value{
sf or sp data frame
}
\description{
This function enables fetching geographic data from the Census Bureau's TigerWeb REST API services
rather than downloading shapefiles. This approach can be faster, especially for users with slow
internet connections or when only a small subset of a larger dataset is needed.
}
\details{
TigerWeb API access requires the arcgislayers package, which provides tools for interacting
with ArcGIS REST services. The function connects to the specified TigerWeb endpoint and executes
a query based on the provided parameters, returning the results as an sf object.

\dontrun{
# Example direct use of load_tiger_api for Cook County, IL census tracts
cook_tracts <- load_tiger_api(
  url = "https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Generalized_ACS2023/Tracts_Blocks/MapServer/4",
  where = "STATE = '17' AND COUNTY = '031'"
)

# Typically used through other tigris functions
cook_tracts_via_function <- tracts("IL", "Cook", use_api = TRUE)
}
