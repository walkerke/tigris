\title{Download a core-based statistical area shapefile into R}
\usage{
core_based_statistical_areas(cb = FALSE, resolution = "500k", year = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cb}{If cb is set to TRUE, download a generalized (1:500k)
cartographic boundary file.  Defaults to FALSE (the most detailed
TIGER/Line file).}

\item{resolution}{The resolution of the cartographic boundary file (if cb == TRUE).
Defaults to '500k'; options include '5m' (1:5 million) and '20m' (1:20 million).}

\item{year}{the data year; defaults to 2022}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to internal function \code{load_tiger}, which is not exported. See Additional Arguments.}

\description{
Core-based statistical areas include both metropolitan areas and micropolitan areas.  The US Census
Bureau defines these areas as follows: "A metro area contains a core urban area of 50,000 or more population, and a
micro area contains an urban core of at least 10,000 (but less than 50,000) population. Each metro or micro area
consists of one or more counties and includes the counties containing the core urban area, as well as any adjacent
counties that have a high degree of social and economic integration (as measured by commuting to work) with the urban
core."  Please see the link provided for more information

\section{Additional Arguments}{

Additional arguments that can be passed in \code{...} are:
\itemize{
\item \code{class} Desired class of return object: \code{"sf"} (the default) or \code{"sp"}.  sp classes should be considered deprecated as of tigris version 2.0, but legacy support is still available.
\item \code{progress_bar} If set to \code{FALSE}, do not display download progress bar (helpful for R Markdown documents). Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
\item \code{keep_zipped_shapefile} If set to \code{TRUE}, do not delete zipped shapefile (stored in temporary directory or \code{TIGRIS_CACHE_DIR}
depending on the configuration of global option \code{"tigris_use_cache"}). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{refresh} Whether to re-download cached shapefiles (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}) . The default is either \code{FALSE} or the value of global
option \code{"tigris_refresh"} if it is set. Specifying this argument will override the behavior set in \code{"tigris_refresh"} global option.
\item \code{filter_by} Geometry used to filter the output returned by the function.  Can be an sf object, an object of class \code{bbox}, or a length-4 vector of format \code{c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)} that can be converted to a bbox. Geometries that intersect the input to \code{filter_by} will be returned.
\item \code{protocol} Character string specifying the protocol to use for downloading files. Options are "ftp" (default) or "http". If "ftp", the URL will be modified to use FTP instead of HTTPS.
\item \code{timeout} Integer specifying the timeout in seconds for download operations. Defaults to 300 (5 minutes) to handle large files.
