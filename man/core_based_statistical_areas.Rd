\title{Download a core-based statistical area shapefile into R}
\usage{
core_based_statistical_areas(cb = FALSE, resolution = "500k", year = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cb}{If cb is set to \code{TRUE}, download a generalized (1:500k)
cartographic boundary file.  Defaults to \code{FALSE} (the most detailed
TIGER/Line file).}

\item{resolution}{The resolution of the cartographic boundary file (if \code{cb = TRUE}). Defaults to "500k"; options include "5m" (1:5 million) and "20m"
(1:20 million).}

\item{year}{year of data to return. As of Jan. 2024,
\code{core_based_statistical_areas} has a maximum year of 2021, a minimum of
2010, and defaults to 2021 if no option is set.}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to internal function \code{load_tiger}, which is
not exported. See Additional Arguments.}

\description{
Core-based statistical areas include both metropolitan areas and micropolitan
areas. The US Census Bureau defines these areas as follows: "A metro area
contains a core urban area of 50,000 or more population, and a micro area
contains an urban core of at least 10,000 (but less than 50,000) population.
Each metro or micro area consists of one or more counties and includes the
counties containing the core urban area, as well as any adjacent counties
that have a high degree of social and economic integration (as measured by
commuting to work) with the urban core." Please see the link provided for
more information

\section{Additional Arguments}{

Additional arguments that can be passed in \code{...} are:
\itemize{
\item \code{class} Desired class of return object: \code{"sf"} (the default) or \code{"sp"}. sp
classes should be considered deprecated as of tigris version 2.0, but legacy
support is still available.
\item \code{progress_bar} If set to \code{FALSE}, do not display download progress bar
(helpful for R Markdown documents). Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
\item \code{keep_zipped_shapefile} If set to \code{TRUE}, do not delete zipped shapefile
(stored in temporary directory or \code{TIGRIS_CACHE_DIR} depending on the
configuration of global option \code{"tigris_use_cache"}). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{refresh} Whether to re-download cached shapefiles (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}). The
default is either \code{FALSE} or the value of global option \code{"tigris_refresh"}
if it is set. Specifying this argument will override the behavior set in
\code{"tigris_refresh"} global option.
\item \code{filter_by} Geometry used to filter the output returned by the function.
Can be an sf OR sfc object, an object of class \code{bbox}, or a length-4 vector
of format \code{c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)} that can be converted to a bbox.
Geometries that intersect the input to \code{filter_by} will be returned.
\item \code{crs} Output coordinate reference system. All TIGER/Shapefiles use a EPSG
4269 coordinate reference system.
\item \code{query} A SQL query passed to \code{\link[sf:st_read]{sf::st_read()}}.
