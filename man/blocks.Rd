\title{Download a Census block shapefile into R}
\usage{
blocks(state, county = NULL, year = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{The two-digit FIPS code (string) of the state you want. Can also
be state name or state abbreviation.}

\item{county}{The three-digit FIPS code (string) of the county you'd like to
subset for, or a vector of FIPS codes if you desire multiple counties. Can
also be a county name or vector of names.}

\item{year}{the data year; defaults to 2022}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to internal function \code{load_tiger}, which is
not exported. See Additional Arguments.}
}
\description{
Description from the US Census Bureau (see link for source): Census blocks
are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as
streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by non-visible boundaries
such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight
extensions of streets and roads. Generally, census blocks are small in area;
for example, a block in a city. Census blocks in suburban and rural areas may
be large, irregular and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads,
streams, and/or transmission line rights-of-way. In remote areas census
blocks may encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover all
territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas. Blocks do
not cross the boundaries of any entity for which the Census Bureau tabulates
data.
}
\details{
This function will download an entire block shapefile for a selected state
into R, and optionally subset by county. \strong{A warning:} Census block
shapefiles are often very large, especially for large states - for example,
the block file for Texas is 462MB zipped!  If you have a slow or unreliable
internet connection, or insufficient memory, this may prove burdensome given
that you have to first download by state and then subset.

\section{Additional Arguments}{

Additional arguments that can be passed in \code{...} are:
\itemize{
\item \code{class} Desired class of return object: \code{"sf"} (the default) or \code{"sp"}. sp
classes should be considered deprecated as of tigris version 2.0, but legacy
support is still available.
\item \code{progress_bar} If set to \code{FALSE}, do not display download progress bar
(helpful for R Markdown documents). Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
\item \code{keep_zipped_shapefile} If set to \code{TRUE}, do not delete zipped shapefile
(stored in temporary directory or \code{TIGRIS_CACHE_DIR} depending on the
configuration of global option \code{"tigris_use_cache"}). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{refresh} Whether to re-download cached shapefiles (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}). The
default is either \code{FALSE} or the value of global option \code{"tigris_refresh"}
if it is set. Specifying this argument will override the behavior set in
\code{"tigris_refresh"} global option.
\item \code{filter_by} Geometry used to filter the output returned by the function.
Can be an sf OR sfc object, an object of class \code{bbox}, or a length-4 vector
of format \code{c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)} that can be converted to a bbox.
Geometries that intersect the input to \code{filter_by} will be returned.
\item \code{crs} Output coordinate reference system. All TIGER/Shapefiles use a EPSG
4269 coordinate reference system.
\item \code{query} A SQL query passed to \code{\link[sf:st_read]{sf::st_read()}}.
