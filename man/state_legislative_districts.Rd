\description{
This function allows you to download boundaries for state legislatures into R.
Generally, state legislatures are comprised of an "upper" house, which is
typically referred to as the Senate, and a "lower" house, which is often (but
not exclusively) referred to as the House.  The exception is Nebraska, which
has a unicameral state legislature.
